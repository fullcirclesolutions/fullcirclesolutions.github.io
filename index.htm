			<a href="#">XRayMachine - Code Generator for XML files</a>
			<div>
				<div class="preScrollable Homepage div-xr-background-img">
					Developers sometimes need to do repetitive tasks. Tools can ease this burden.
					XML has been and continues to be a common data format for a long time. 
					It is likely that, like Cobol it will continue to persist in both contemporary and legacy applications for decades to come.
					What if there was a tool that made working with XML a breeze?
					XRayMachine is just that tool. XRayMachine creates an accessor class for any XML file enabling easy access to every attribute and collection contained therein.
