		Hi, I'm Andrew Gray and I have worked in consulting firms since I left university.  I have seen similar issues crop up again and again in many different firms in many different industries.
		In 2013, I created Full Circle solutions to do something about them.
		We have found that there are areas that are often overlooked or undervalued.  The comment or attitude we constantly see is "I'll just hack something together this time...". However "this time" is never a one off. What eventually is produced is a cobbled collection of scripts that only the author knows how to run correctly.
		We build innovative tools and products that address common problems to make people's lives easier.
