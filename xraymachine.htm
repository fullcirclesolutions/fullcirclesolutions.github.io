<h1>XRayMachine</h1>
<h2>Standard Edition</h2>
Files that represent data, like XML files, have a strongly defined structure.  So defined, in fact, that it is possible to generate a source code file.
An "accessor class", if you will.  Being able to generate an accessor class for any XML file to access every element value and collection automates what 
was a repetitive mechanical process for developers in the past.  Save time with XRayMachine!
