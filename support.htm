		Listening to you, the customer, is our first priority here at Full Circle Solutions. It drives everything we do.  To help us deliver on that commitment we have teamed with a number of partners
		to provide a number of forums through which you can view the development process and be actively engaged in it.  Be it to vote on and suggest upcoming features or let us 
		know about areas we haven't quite got right yet.<br/>
		We like to think of it as being kind of like watching the coffee merchant roasting the beans or watching the tandoor cook up a feast!
