					<div class="col-md-8">
						<p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Full Circle Solutions we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.</b></li>
							<li><b>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</b></li>
							<li><b>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</b></li>
						</ul>
						<p>Full Circle Solutions ("Full Circle”) operates website fullcirclesolutions.com.au. It is Full Circle’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>

						<p><b>Website Visitors</b></p>
						<p>Like most website operators, Full Circle collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Full Circle’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Full Circle’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Full Circle may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
						<p>Full Circle also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users.</p>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-8">
						<p><b>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</b></p>
						<p>Certain visitors to Full Circle’s websites choose to interact with Full Circle in ways that require Full Circle to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Full Circle gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Full Circle are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Full Circle collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Full Circle. Full Circle does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
						<p>This Application does not support “do not track” requests.</p>

						<p><b>Aggregated Statistics</b></p>
						<p>Full Circle may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Full Circle may monitor the most popular links or screen the links help identify spam. Full Circle may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Full Circle does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

						<p><b>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</b></p>
						<p>Full Circle discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Full Circle’s behalf or to provide services available at Full Circle’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Full Circle’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Full Circle will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Full Circle discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Full Circle believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Full Circle, third parties or the public at large.</p>
						<p>If you are a registered user of an Full Circle website and have supplied your email address, Full Circle may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Full Circle and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Full Circle takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
