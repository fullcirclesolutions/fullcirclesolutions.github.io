			<p>Saucery for NUnit is a <b>DesiredCapabilities factory</b> component that you reference from your .NET test projects to make automated testing with SauceLabs easy.</p>
			<p>Saucery also:</p>

			<ul class="info-list md-list style i-primary primary">
				<li><i class="fa fa-play"></i>Handles Flow Control (NUnit 3 Edition) - so you don't send too many tests to SauceLabs at once thus avoiding parallel-limit rejections.</li>
				<li><i class="fa fa-play"></i>Communicates test outcomes back to SauceLabs - Passed or Failed on your dashboard is better than Finished.</li>
				<li><i class="fa fa-play"></i>Handles various settings for you out of the box that respect your precious testing minutes thus maximising them.</li>
				<li><i class="fa fa-play"></i>Provides human-readable console messages.</li>
				<li><i class="fa fa-play"></i>Includes various utility classes to help with writing tests and PageObjects.</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="space-sm"></div>
			<p>With all this plumbing taken care of by Saucery, you and your team can remain focussed on writing the tests to satisfy the business needs of your application.</p>
