		If there are customizations that you'd like to make, or if you would feel safer by knowing that you have a copy of the source on hand should a problem arise, 
		we can offer source code licenses.

		After purchasing, we'll invite you to a private Git repository hosted on BitBucket containing the product code. The great thing about using a DVCS like Git is 
		that it means you can easily merge our modifications with any that you make yourself. <a href="/eula.pdf">Read the full license agreement</a>.
